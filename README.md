## Design

### Planning

I wireframed the website using Balsamiq to get a better idea of the layout. Not much the actual theme, but the structure. The images were merely placed there to give it life.

![Balsamiq](./assets/readme/balsamiq-readme.png)

The website, being one-paged, and more visual content than informational, it needed to be aestetically pleasing to scroll down.

To achieve this i left the main content (The Why, The Secret, The Answer) be static and inbetween them let the backgrounds run in parallax effect. This lets the user focus on what's static, whilst taking in the vibe from the background-parallax.

### Details

Throughout the website I added the same shade of wine-red in tiny forms. Not much, just enough to go with the theme.

![MoodBoard](./assets/readme/details-readme.png)

Mobile Details:

In order to keep the user focused on the story borders were added on mobile to the text content sections.

![Mobile Border](./assets/readme/mobile-border-readme.png)

### Fonts

Fonts used were the playful and edgy "Rock salt" for the headings and "Oswald" as a compliment. Both works well on a black background and Oswald brings out the importance of the text.

### Structure

The structure is entirely made of boxes in a 1-2 sequence. An image followed by actual content assisted by a related image. This in order to keep focus on the written content (the story) as the user scrolls.

### Imagery

As guidance for the theme of the website I had my moodboard with a collection of images, which colors and character built the palette with a base of black.

### Features Left to Implement

-   A way to make sure the image being sent in is in fact their own dog. As well as see

### Lighthouse

Lighthouse analysis came back positive on desktop

![Lighthouse](./assets/readme/lighthouse-desktop-readme.png)

Mobile:
Due to the website being image-heavy I completed a trial of compressing all images to WebP but performance dropped below 70 and I decided to stick with jpg/png.

![Lighthouse](./assets/readme/lighthouse-mobile-readme.png)

### Validator Testing

-   HTML
    -   No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
-   CSS
    -   No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

## Problems and Solutions

### Safari auto-fill

In contrary to Chromes autofill (which turned it white, as you can see further down) Safari turns it a yellow-ish color which had to be changed since it didn't fit the theme of the website and didn't give off a professional look.

Solution was the below code:

```
input:-webkit-autofill,
input:-webkit-autofill:hover, input:-webkit-autofill:focus, input:-webkit-autofill:active {
    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0 60px #fafafa inset !important; background-color: #fafafa !important; background-clip: content-box !important; }
```

This worked on all websites, turning the background caused by auto-fill to turn white.

### iPad/iPad pro portrait/landscape

The issue I ran into portrayed itself in the logo, as well as the background images being zoomed in.
The logo went over the below section on both portrait and landscape. Below code fixed both issues:

```@media only screen and (min-device-width: 768px) and (max-device-width: 1370px) and (orientation: landscape) {
    .hero-image {
        min-height: 1100px;
        background-attachment: scroll;
    }
    .parallax-three,
    .parallax-two,
    .parallax-four,
    .form-section {
        background-attachment: scroll;
    }
}
```

By turning off parallax not only for mobile, but for iPad as well, the images looked fantastic. The height change for the hero-image solved the logo issue on both portrait and landscape.

## Unfixed Bugs

### Chrome auto-fill:

Although not a fault of my initial code, but a lack thereof, chrome auto-fill turns the background white. Considering I found it not to be going away from the theme of the website i left it "unfixed" at first.

## Deployment

-   The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    -   In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    -   From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    -   Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
