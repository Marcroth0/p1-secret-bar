            <h2>The Why</h2>
            <h3>Edward Von Va Bene, a traveller of thought, knitter of mittens, master-petter of dogs, alcohol-enthusiast, skim-reader of books but hater of milk that is skimmed, decided a spring morning in 1923 he needed a place to be at peace, whilst simultaneously surrounded by his peers. In front of the fireplace, a few nights thereafter, his beloved dog confused as to why he suddenly stopped the petting nudged at his ancles. Edward met his sand-colored eyes and whispered: "Va Bene, Va Bene Bar!" <br>Legend has it the dog burst out in a howl so great it still can be heard in the most silent of nights, with a sip of a great drink, and a dash of belief. </h3>

            <h2>The Secret</h2>
            <h3>Weekend after weekend, month after month, people of all kinds came to explore the signature drinks of the infamous Holy Grail, the Atlantis, the Solitude, and The Shepherd - ingredients of which never to be revealed. Loud mouths, drunken bastards, and broken glass, forced Edward to close the bar and again be left alone with his dog. Torn by the immediate success he turned to the drawing board, desperate to find a way to fulfill his dream of a perfect getaway. He realised, the only way to maintain a perfect balance of peace and noise is to keep it a secret and constantly be on the move. In order to know of it's whereabouts you were asked a question.
