# Va Bene Bar

The Va Bene Bar is a site that will help the curious, the artistic, the seeker of tiny adventures, to find a bar suitable for them. A secret will always be an attractive aspect to an activity, because of the simple reason that it's fun to talk about it. The site hopes to do just that, attract peoples interest in being one of the few that get to visit it.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

-   **Navigation Bar**

    -   The full responsive Navbar includes links to three parts of the page. Considering it's a one-page website they needed to be equally devided in thirds.
    -   One part defines a part of the websites story (The Why, The Secret, The Answer)

![Nav Bar](./assets/readme/navbar-readme.png)

-   **The landing page image**

    -   A big centered logo in front of a background that sets the mood of the rest of the website.
    -   The Parallax-effect instantly sets the need for scrolling to stay on the site.

    -   The user will connect the lightbulb with it having something to do with an idea.

# Design

## Planning

I wireframed the website using Balsamiq to get a better idea of the layout. Not much the actual theme, but the structure. The images were merely placed there to give it life.

![Balsamiq](./assets/readme/balsamiq-readme.png)

The website, being one-paged, and more visual content than informational, it needed to be aestetically pleasing to scroll down.

To achieve this i left the main content (The Why, The Secret, The Answer) be static and inbetween them let the backgrounds run in parallax effect. This lets the user focus on what's static, whilst taking in the vibe from the parallax.

As guidance for the theme of the website I had my moodboard with a collection of images, which colors and character built the palette with a base of black.

## Details

Throughout the website I added the same shade of wine-red in tiny forms. Not much, just enough to go with the theme.

### Features Left to Implement

-   A way to make sure the image being sent in is in fact their own dog. As well as see

## Testing

I tested the responsiveness of the site on the below units, using chrome dev tools:

-   Moto G4 (360x640)
-   Galaxy S5 (360x640)
-   Pixel 2 (411x731)
-   Pixel 2 XL (411x823)
-   iPhone 5/SE (320x568)
-   iPhone 6/7/8 (375x667)
-   iPhone 6/7/8 Plus (414x736)
-   iPhone X (375x812)
-   iPad (768x1024)
-   iPad Pro (1024x1366)

The site worked perfectly on all devices, besides the iPad and iPad Pro. In these the Logos bottom pierced the div underneath. Solution is under "Problems and fixes"

### Validator Testing

-   HTML
    -   No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
-   CSS
    -   No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

### chrome auto-fill:

Al though not a fault of my initial code, but a lack thereof, chrome auto-fill turns the background white. Considering I found it not to be going away from the theme of the website i left it "unfixed".

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

-   The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    -   In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    -   From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    -   Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

-   One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

    -   Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood

-   When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

    -   For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.

-   Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
    -   [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
    -   [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
    -   [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
