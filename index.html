                    Fabrizio Von Va Bene, a traveller of thought, knitter of
                    mittens, master-petter of dogs, alcohol-enthusiast,
                    skim-reader of books but hater of milk that is skimmed,
                    decided a spring morning in 1923 he needed a place to be at
                    peace. In front of the fireplace, a few nights thereafter,
                    his beloved dog nudged at his ankles; confused as to why he
                    suddenly stopped petting. Fabrizio met his sand-colored eyes
                    and whispered: "Va Bene, Va Bene Bar!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legend has it the dog burst out in a howl so great it to
                    this day still echoes in the most silent of nights, after a
                    sip from a great drink, and a dash of belief.

                <h2>The Secret</h2>
                <p>
                    Weekend after weekend, month after month, people of all
                    kinds came to explore the signature drinks of the infamous
                    <span class="text-underline">Pup</span>,
                    <span class="text-underline">The Silence</span>,
                    <span class="text-underline">The Solitude</span>, and
                    <span class="text-underline">The Shepherd</span> -
                    ingredients of which never to be revealed. Loud mouths,
                    drunken bastards, and broken glass, forced Fabrizio to close
                    the bar and again be left alone with his dog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Torn by the immediate success he turned to the drawing
                    board, desperate to find a way to fulfill his dream of a
                    perfect getaway. He realised, the only way to maintain a
                    perfect balance of peace and noise is to keep it a secret
                    and constantly be on the move. In order to know of its
                    whereabouts you were asked a question.
